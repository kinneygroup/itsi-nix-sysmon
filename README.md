### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, SystemHealth is dependent on the CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Processes, Services, Logs, and Security services. Each of these services provides critical metrics that contribute to the overall system health.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as SystemHealth depending on the aggregated metrics from CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Processes, Services, Logs, and Security, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
